WiNDC Data Scientist. Intersted in Python and Julia.

All of my recent work has been in my two organizations:

- [MPSGE](https://github.com/julia-mpsge)
- [WiNDC](https://github.com/uw-windc)

I would like to particularly highlight [MPSGE.jl](https://github.com/julia-mpsge/MPSGE.jl), a tool that automates to process of writing economic models.
